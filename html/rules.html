Welcome to The Wasteland, an immersive roleplay experience for those seeking to appreciate the dangers of a post-apocalyptic wasteland! These rules will serve to cover the innumerable amount of possible roleplay situations as possible - though the ruling decision is ultimately up to the administrator. If you have any questions, utilize an adminhelp (F1) and ask us for help or oversight!<br>
Rules:<br>

  
General
1. We can’t possibly cover all situations - staff online need the elasticity to rule on niche situations that aren’t explicitly covered by the rules. Once this rule is invoked, the staff that invoked this rule will be liable for the outcome of the situation, and the ruling made will be held for that one round only.<br>
2. You must be 18 years of age to join the community and play on our servers as there are adult themed references and interactions. Staff, at any moment or reason, can request age verification by means of an ID with all information but DOB omitted.<br>
3. No use of slurs or excessively edgy/racial humor.  Do not be toxic towards or harass other players or staff.<br>
3. Always stay in character, only break away in LOOC or OOC to resolve issues as needed.<br>
5. You must wait until the 1 hour 30 minute mark in order raid. After said mark, factions are no longer immune to raid restrictions. Multiple raids are allowed, but must have a strong in-character reason as to why further raids are necessary (you can always ahelp to “ask” if your escalation justification basis is sufficient).<br>
6. Try to roleplay when fighting, always escalate properly, and try to work things out before resorting to mechanics.<br>
7. Keep characters individual, do not respawn as the same character if they’ve died in that round, if they hadn’t died, but simply matrix’d, you can rejoin the round as the same character; and do not jump roles between major factions without valid IC reasoning.<br>
8. Do not abuse mechanics intentionally for a PVP or PVE advantage. You may use defences like barricades, buildings and other cover for PVE, but do not abuse game mechanics. <br>
9. Do not use meta communications during the round. Don’t go into discord to message your friend to come save you when you die.  This includes joining a voice chat with other players in the round.  Once a round ends you are free to talk about what happened but do not use this information as if you actually know it in character. Example: A character joins a new faction and tells a group out of game after the round ends. That group of players should not then take that information and use it ICLY as if they learned it ingame. Pretend you don’t know until you are told ingame.<br>
10. You may break into locked buildings without requesting permission; it has to be goal oriented (otherwise - for what reason), and escalated. These may be players' homes or faction bases. The first ten minutes of the start of the round are protected OOC from breaking in to.<br>
11. English is the main required language to use while playing. You must speak English or be able to write it in order for our staff to assist you as well as the community. We don’t turn down anyone though if you can’t speak English that’s fine but you’ll have to work with us if an issue arises.<br>
12. Do not kill AFK or disconnected players. Move them somewhere safe, but do not steal from or harm them.<br>
13. In order to fight there must be escalation. It begins with a conversation, emotes with intentions and visible combat readiness from both sides before fighting mechanically may begin. Be polite and respectable so both players are ready to fight before starting. Provided here is an example of how said escalation should result - escalation.<br>
14. Erotic roleplay is allowed but you must follow a few guidelines. No underage references at ALL. Second, you must get OOC consent from the player to do so. If you’re doing a non consensual scene, you both must verify that you’re accepting it via LOOC. Third, try to be subtle about it and keep to yourself. This way you wont get judged, you won't be harassed and you can enjoy your roleplay in privacy.<br>
15. Do not judge people's roleplay, don’t poke fun, don’t go out of your way to harass people or create grudges. Have fun and enjoy yourself. People will make mistakes, as you make mistakes, learn from them and be patient as others do the same so that way we can create something great.<br>
16. Do not share any personal information of any of the community members to anyone else. No private information should be disclosed within server resources. If there is a personal feud between individuals that involves personal information outside of the community your access to our resources will be denied to protect our community members.<br>
17. Do not with malicious intent hide a body after you’ve killed a person in order to keep them out of the round. Factions may capture bodies of those they’ve killed but only if their intentions are to revive the person and enslave or trade the player back to the faction. Do not destroy a player's brain on purpose to remove them from the game, and lastly - help everyone playing by matrixing permanently dead/comatose characters, so role slots unlock.<br>
18. If you die and stay dead for an excess of 10 minutes, then you will not remember the events that lead up to your death prior when revived.<br>
