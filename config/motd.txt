<h1>Welcome to Fortune13</h1>
Relaxed HRP<br>
Fallout Fortune is an in-depth, heavy roleplay experience, coding based off of modern /tg/2020 with Citadel modifications, avid Fallout fans volunteering as members of staff, and unique lore expansive and genuine to Fallout material, based on the West Coast of Fallout. Due to graphic themes, this is an 18+ community with no exceptions. Low quality roleplay or breach of atmosphere is not tolerated. It is HIGHLY advised you understand the server lore or Fallout franchise as a whole before entering and roleplaying to minimize administrative action.<br>
